## Bio  
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech, specializing in optimization. Prior to my graduate studies, I pursued research across dynamical systems, CR geometry, functional analysis, and econometrics. I hold undergraduate degrees in Mathematics (with honors) and Statistics from the University of Chicago.
