## Bio  
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in probability and statistics. Prior to my graduate studies, I pursued research across dynamical systems, CR geometry, functional analysis, and econometrics. I hold undergraduate degrees in Mathematics (with honors) and Statistics from the University of Chicago.
